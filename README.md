# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Background:  Help the foundation predict where to make investments.
   Using machine learning and neural networks, use the features in the provided dataset to 
   create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful 
   if funded by Alphabet Soup.
   
   From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations 
   that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns 
   that capture metadata about each organization.
   
### Deliverables:
    1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
    2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
    3: Optimize the Model
    4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model
